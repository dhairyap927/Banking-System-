5. **Make Payments**: Customers can use this feature to make payments for various services, such as electricity bills. They provide the necessary payment details, including the bill amount and recipient information. The system validates the payment details and processes the payment, updating the account balance accordingly.

**Note:**
Please ensure that you have the `banking.jar` file from the provided `jar` folder added to the build path of your project as an external library. This JAR file contains necessary dependencies for the Banking System project to function properly. 

Additionally, for the database setup, make sure you have a MySQL database named "bank". The root user with the password "Dhruv123" should have access to this database. Adjust the database credentials in the `DBConnection.java` file to match your MySQL configuration.

Please follow the setup instructions in the previous sections to complete the project setup and configuration.
